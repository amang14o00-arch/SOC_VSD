# SoC Tapeout


## RISC-V Tapeout Program (VSD)

The **RISC-V Tapeout Program by VSD (Kunal Ghosh)** is a hands-on, project-driven initiative that walks you through the **complete chip design lifecycle**. Starting from RISC-V ISA and microarchitecture, you will design, verify, and implement your own SoC/IP and prepare it for **tapeout** (fabrication-ready GDSII).


### 🚀 What You Will Do

* **RISC-V ISA & Microarchitecture** – Understand the fundamentals of RISC-V and build RTL designs in Verilog.
* **RTL Design & Simulation** – Model processor components, simulate functionality, and verify correctness.
* **Logic Synthesis** – Translate RTL into gate-level netlists with open-source synthesis tools.
* **Physical Design Flow** – Perform floorplanning, placement, routing, CTS, and verification using OpenLANE.
* **Tapeout Preparation** – Generate final **GDSII layouts** with the SkyWater 130nm PDK, ready for fabrication.


### 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Verilog / SystemVerilog** – RTL design & simulation
* **OpenLANE** – Complete RTL-to-GDSII flow
* **SkyWater 130nm PDK** – Open-source process design kit for fabrication
* **Magic / KLayout** – Layout design & inspection
* **Yosys** – Logic synthesis
* **OpenSTA** – Static timing analysis
* **ngspice** – Circuit simulation
